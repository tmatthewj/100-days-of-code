# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup Vue Cli using NPM for my todo-app. And got the dummy Vue page to load on the localhost.

**Thoughts:** I followed instructions from the blog-post - https://paweljw.github.io/2017/09/vue.js-front-end-app-part-1-setting-up-the-app/ to set up Vue cli. Will need to read more about how Vue works (data-view binding etc to get some sample app working).
