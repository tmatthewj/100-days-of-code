# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*Day 1*: August 4, 2018

*Today's Progress*: Setup Vue Cli using NPM for my todo-app. And got the dummy Vue page to load on the localhost.

*Thoughts:* I followed instructions from the blog-post - https://paweljw.github.io/2017/09/vue.js-front-end-app-part-1-setting-up-the-app/ to set up Vue cli. Will need to read more about how Vue works (data-view binding etc to get some sample app working).


*Day 2*: August 5, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: Understanding webpack, webpack-simple projecting packagings. Tried creating a vue project with webpack-simple and getting it to work. Couldn’t make out a few parts. Will spend more time tomorrow to understand this better. Ref I used - https://codeburst.io/building-your-very-first-component-with-vuejs-21b4a2f6a15a.

*Day 3*: August 6, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: I realised I need to understand Vue at better detail before starting to work on the project. Started going through tutorials put up here - https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/ with hands on example.

*Day 4*: August 7, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continuing with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 2. I will prefer to complete this in the days to come to get started. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.  https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/.
