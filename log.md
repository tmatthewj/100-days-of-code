# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*Day 1*: August 4, 2018

*Today's Progress*: Setup Vue Cli using NPM for my todo-app. And got the dummy Vue page to load on the localhost.

*Thoughts:* I followed instructions from the blog-post - https://paweljw.github.io/2017/09/vue.js-front-end-app-part-1-setting-up-the-app/ to set up Vue cli. Will need to read more about how Vue works (data-view binding etc to get some sample app working).


*Day 2*: August 5, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: Understanding webpack, webpack-simple projecting packagings. Tried creating a vue project with webpack-simple and getting it to work. Couldn’t make out a few parts. Will spend more time tomorrow to understand this better. Ref I used - https://codeburst.io/building-your-very-first-component-with-vuejs-21b4a2f6a15a.

*Day 3*: August 6, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: I realised I need to understand Vue at better detail before starting to work on the project. Started going through tutorials put up here - https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/ with hands on example.

*Day 4*: August 7, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continuing with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 2. I will prefer to complete this in the days to come to get started. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.  https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/. 

*Day 5*: August 8, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continuing with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 3,4. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.  https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/.

*Day 6*: August 9, 2018

*Day 7*: August 10, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 7. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go. Hope to complete remaining 4 over the weekend.

*Day 8*: August 11, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued with Vue Mastery tutorials on components and communicating between components via events. Didn’t try the hands on challenges - will be taking them up tomorrow for these tutorials.

*Day 9*: August 12, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Completed Vue Mastery tutorials - forms and tabs. Did some hands on exercise on events and components. Next step - understand how webpack helps you create boilerplate expressJS + vueJs app - understand that to good detail.

*Day 10*: August 13, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Implemented the challenges related to components and event handling on Vue based on the tutorials. Evaluating if I should go ahead and learn about using a nodejs - vuejs app or spend some more time understanding the advanced concepts of Vue based on the next level of Vue mastery tutorials.

*Day 11: August 14, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*:  Read about how to setup a project on Vue and the different components involved. Also learned a bit about node packaging - how it works, why package-lock, package.json exist etc. Also ended the session by creating a Vue project using vue-cli. Next steps - learn how Vue-ex and Vue-router works.
