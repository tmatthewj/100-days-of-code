# 100 Days Of Code - Log

*Day 1*: August 4, 2018

*Today's Progress*: Setup Vue Cli using NPM for my todo-app. And got the dummy Vue page to load on the localhost.

*Thoughts:* I followed instructions from the blog-post - https://paweljw.github.io/2017/09/vue.js-front-end-app-part-1-setting-up-the-app/ to set up Vue cli. Will need to read more about how Vue works (data-view binding etc to get some sample app working).


*Day 2*: August 5, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: Understanding webpack, webpack-simple projecting packagings. Tried creating a vue project with webpack-simple and getting it to work. Couldn’t make out a few parts. Will spend more time tomorrow to understand this better. Ref I used - https://codeburst.io/building-your-very-first-component-with-vuejs-21b4a2f6a15a.

*Day 3*: August 6, 2018

*Today’s Progress*: I realised I need to understand Vue at better detail before starting to work on the project. Started going through tutorials put up here - https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/ with hands on example.

*Day 4*: August 7, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continuing with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 2. I will prefer to complete this in the days to come to get started. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.  https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/. 

*Day 5*: August 8, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continuing with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 3,4. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.  https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/vue-instance/.

*Day 6*: August 9, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 5,6. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go.

*Day 7*: August 10, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued with Vue Mastery tutorials. Completed 7. These tutorials have small hands on tests. Doing them as I go. Hope to complete remaining 4 over the weekend.

*Day 8*: August 11, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued with Vue Mastery tutorials on components and communicating between components via events. Didn’t try the hands on challenges - will be taking them up tomorrow for these tutorials.

*Day 9*: August 12, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Completed Vue Mastery tutorials - forms and tabs. Did some hands on exercise on events and components. Next step - understand how webpack helps you create boilerplate expressJS + vueJs app - understand that to good detail.

*Day 10*: August 13, 2018

*Today’s Progress*:  Implemented the challenges related to components and event handling on Vue based on the tutorials. Evaluating if I should go ahead and learn about using a nodejs - vuejs app or spend some more time understanding the advanced concepts of Vue based on the next level of Vue mastery tutorials.

*Day 11: August 14, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*:  Read about how to setup a project on Vue and the different components involved. Also learned a bit about node packaging - how it works, why package-lock, package.json exist etc. Also ended the session by creating a Vue project using vue-cli. Next steps - learn how Vue-ex and Vue-router works.

*Day 12: August 16, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*:  The previous day I got hands on with Basim’s typewriting demo. One thing I understood is that my motivation is also to learn a bit more about how an app works and how Vue works instead of just focusing on the front-end alone or Vue specifics. This is because my overall understanding is still shallow and that needs to improve. I learned a bit about reactive programming and how it has it’s roots built on the oop concept of observer pattern. Tutorial I followed - Build a reactivity system by Vue Mastery.


*Day 13: August 18, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: I continued with the 2nd tutorial on the Advanced Component section where Evan You talks about how they are rewriting the reactivity system with the library called Proxies in Vue 2.x. This tutorial, I thought would give me more perspective on reactive programming. But I found it difficult to follow and look a while to complete.(link - https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/advanced-components/evan-you-on-proxies) Lesson - I will now start looking at getting started with the app instead of pure theory session.


*Day 14: August 19, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Started following a tutorial for to-do app that I could understand and relate to much better because of the learnings. https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2 . Will be continuing with this to complete a basic prototype of to-do app.

*Day 15: August 21, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*:  Continued working on the todo-app tutorial by scotch.io. I got stuck pretty early in the steps, something to do with how I’m referencing a component in another file. Even though I didn’t get through to solve the problem (and make progress), I thought it’s better that I understand these issues better instead of trying to learn Vue in isolation. Today, Basim recommended that I take a look at Nuxt to build lighter vue apps. I might plan to do it after finishing this tutorial.

*Day 16: August 22, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: I continued to try and fix the issue with component referencing. Tried a lot of trial and error but with no help. Basically, got to know that the tutorial has a lot of comments that evaluate it as one with incomplete steps etc. But I think this would be a perfect for me to learn each component step by step and make progress (think of a tutorial with a few errors planted and you are expected to learn it. Could be exciting right?) . So will continue to uncover it step by step and get to completion. Will take Basim / Srijith’s help with a few things, when I meet them in office.

*Day 17: August 23, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: I fixed the issue that was not building my todo code successfully. Apparently the way I setup the project was different from the way the author set it up. The tutorial was setup to not use Vue Router where as I had marked yes for it. This resulted in different ways of referencing sub-components in a given base component. I’m continuing with the tutorial. Finding it really helpful because of a few errors in it (good chance to google and learn what the issue is). Hope to wrap this up in next 2 sessions.

*Day 18: August 24, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with the tutorial. Implemented the edit experience on todo item UI.

*Day 19: August 26, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with the tutorial. Implemented the add new todo item UI. Got stuck while doing this as I couldn’t get the event dispatch logic to work fine. After some research, figured out that event listener methods corresponding to an event dispatcher within component A can only be present in a parent component that has A as a child. It basically functions in the opposite direction of how Props are used..

*Day 20: August 27, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Completed the tutorial with the task complete UI and logic. Will now continue with Nuxt tutorial from tomorrow.

*Day 21: August 29, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Got hold of tutorials from Basim and started watching them. Completed half the chapters of Getting Started 01. Didn’t do any hands-on coding with the tutorial.

*Day 22: August 30, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Completed all the tutorials of Getting Started 01. Didn’t do any hands-on coding. I was pretty tired this day. Crashed with the laptop in my hand if I remember correctly.*

*Day 23: September 1, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Went through the steps of creating the app as we did in Basim’s session. Made some changes on the app and also learned to use emmet for autocompleting constructs.

*Day 24: September 2, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Read more about client side routing and how it helps to build single page apps. Got a little drifted by reading about why some of the big apps like FB uses client side routing. Started watching page routing views tutorials (chapter 2) and completed 2 of them.

Last week has been a super hectic week for me. A couple of days, I just tried to do 100days to tick it off the day but couldn’t be in a state of enough energy to spend that 1 hour properly. Will try to manage these things better going forward.

*Day 25: September 3, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with page routing views tutorials (chapter 2) 3 and 4. Mostly catching up with what Basim taught in the tech-session. Extra - learned how to navigate to pages by taking in user parameter (eg param Id) in a page and then using $router.push method to go to another page using client side routing.

*Day 26: September 4, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with page routing views tutorials (chapter 2) 5 and 6. Mostly catching up with what Basim taught in the tech-session. Extra - learned about nesting routes - a neat way to have a base component rendering in all pages within a base route. Eg. Having a search bar for all user/ pages to go to another user page.

*Day 27: September 5, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Wrapped up with all the tutorials related to pages, routing and views on Nuxt (most of what Basim covered). Will move on to the blog project now. Planning to complete it before anything else while coding along with the tutorials.

*Day 28: September 6, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Started off with the blog project. Covered tutorial 1 and 2. Created a few basic pages like admin / posts/xxx, about with some styling for the pages. Also learned how to use nuxt-config to load link items across the project (example - font for all pages).

*Day 29: September 7, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with blog project. Covered the landing page creation, splitting of posts into different components and adding static assets like an background image for the blog landing page.

*Day 30: September 8, 2018*

*Today’s Progress*: Continued with blog project. Worked on the post page and settling up the admin page with basic create new post flow. Some of the components where provided in the tutorial. But spent some time looking at their make-up and setup. Overall the project is getting pretty exciting. Looking forward to make progress every day.

*Day 31: September 9, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Completed the section related to page routing for the blog project. Specifically wrapped up showing posts in editable format when visited via the admin route. Looking forward to the next section of tutorials that are about handling data.

*Day 32: September 10, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Started with handling data for the blog. First step was to make sure the post list information is loaded on the main page, as if it comes from a server instead of pulling it from a data object in the client side. Learnt what DataAsync and Created means in the flow of rendering a page on Nuxt.

*Day 33: September 11, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Continued with data-handling part of the blog setup. Got to look more closely at Context object in AsyncData, handling errors with a callback and using promises instead of callback in AsyncData. Not all of it is very clear to me right now. Will read up a bit more about how promises vs callbacks differ.

*Day 34: September 12, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Got started with using Vuex to maintain the state of the blog. Used Vuex store in the `/posts/` page of the blog. While doing this, I kept getting 'unknown action type' error when I was doing a store.commit. After quite a lot of searching, I realised the importance of <space> after the name of a given mutation or action in the store file. Got to read up more about these conventions.

*Day 35: September 13, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Implemented NuxtServerInit for loading the posts data (instead of using AsyncData that's used to fetch on a per page basis). NSI is used to initialise your app with critical data at the start of the app session. At a high level, learnt that you can decide if you want to load data on per page basis or store it in Vuex and get it as and when required. Next will get started on using a real back-end for data.

*Day 36: September 14, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Learned a hacky way to run server-side code in NuxtServerInit /  AsyncData etc (check if it's on client side) but this is not recommended (need to read more) for at least pulling data. More about it later in the tutorial I think. 

Setup Firebase account and project for nuxt-blog. In the admin view, linked submit post method to push the data to firebase using Axios library to make post request.

*Day 37: September 15, 2018*

*Today's Progress*:  Continued linking the different pieces of the blog with firebase back-end. User flows updated to use firebase back-end: updating / editing a given blog post in admin view, showing existing blog posts in all views (including admin view), creating a new post. Next - need to ensure the Vue store is in sync with the data on the server (which is not the case now).

*Day 38: September 16, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Moved all the post data updation (like edit, add posts) logic inside store where the back-end is made in sync with the store data. Post data getter requests (for a given post page) are still spread out outside the store. This can be optmised to pick the data from store getters (which wraps around back-end calls). With this wrapped up the module of linking the blog to a real back-end. Few things to understand in detail: what is the difference between $route and $router.

*Day 39: September 17, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Did a bit of refactoring around ensuring all axios calls happen from the store and not from any page components (not sure if it's relevant though :P). While doing this, also learned how to use Store getters with params passed (more details here - [https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html) - method style access). After that got started with nuxt-config tutorials on how to set env variables, special route configs and even page to page transition animations. 

*Day 40: September 18, 2018*

*Today's Progress*: Continued with other configs that can be added on nuxt-config. Learned how to use plugins and modules in a given nuxt app.
